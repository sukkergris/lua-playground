# docker-compose.yml
services:
  app: # Or name it 'devcontainer', 'workspace', etc.
    # Use variable substitution for the image name
    image: ${DOCKER_USERNAME}/${REPO_NAME}:${IMAGE_TAG}
    build:
      context: . # Your project root
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    # Add other service configurations if needed (ports, volumes, etc.)
    # command: sleep infinity # Keep container running if needed for devcontainer attach

# You might not need a 'services' section if you only want to build/push
# an image managed outside of compose runtime.
# But defining it allows `docker compose build/push`.
